                <h1>FOOTBALL RULES</h1>
                <p>Football matches are played between two teams and typically last for 90 minutes. The match is divided into two halves of 45 minutes each. <br>

                    There's a 15-minute break called half-time which separates the two halves. <br>
                    
                    A match kicks off from the centre circle with one team in possession of the ball. <br>
                    
                    The teams switch sides after half-time, with the other team in possession and kicking off proceedings. <br>
                    
                    The objective of each team is to kick or head the football within the opposing team’s goalposts to score a goal. <br></p>
                
                
                    <h3>Throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks</h3>
                
                    <p>If the ball crosses the side-lines after taking a touch from a player, it results in a throw-in for the opposition team. <br>

                    During a throw-in, a player stands outside the side-lines and throws the ball back into play, usually to a team-mate. <br>
                    
                    However, the player taking the throw-in needs to have both his feet planted to the ground while releasing the ball from above his head for it to count as a legal throw. <br>
                    
                    If a ball crosses the goal-line from either side of the goalpost or over it, two outcomes are possible. <br>
                    
                    If the ball is sent out because of an attacking player, it results in a goal kick to the defending team. <br>
                    
                    A goal-kick allows the defending team to kick the ball back into play from anywhere inside the 6-yard-box. <br>
                    
                    If the ball is sent out by a player from the defending team, then the attacking team gets a corner kick. During a corner kick, a player from the attacking <br> team can place the ball near the corner flag (which is the closest to the area from where the ball went out of bounds) and kick it in play. <br>
                    
                    Corner kicks are considered good scoring opportunities.</p>

                    
                    
                    <h3>Fouls, cards, free kicks and penalty kicks</h3>
               
               
                    <p>When a team is in possession, the opposing team tries to intercept the ball or tackle the player in possession to gain control over the ball. <br>

                    However, if the tackle is deemed too dangerous or illegal by a referee or assistant referee, a foul is called. <br>
                    
                    Players touching the ball, intentionally or unintentionally, with their hands is also considered a foul. This rule doesn’t apply for goalkeepers as <br> long as they are in their own penalty area.
                    
                    Depending on the severity of the foul, a referee can either  <br>let a player off with a warning or show them a card. Every foul, though, doesn’t warrant a card. <br>
                    
                    A yellow card is shown if a foul is considered severe enough and the accumulation of two yellow cards in a match results in a red card. The player shown a red card has <br>to immediately leave the field and is also suspended for the next match. <br></p>


                
                    <h3>Extra time in football games</h3>
                
                
                    <p>If both teams don’t score any or end up scoring the same number of goals at the end of 90 minutes and injury time, the match is declared a draw. <br>

                    However, in certain situations like knockout games and finals of tournaments, a winner needs to be decided. <br>
                    
                    Situations such as these are solved through extra time and penalty shootouts. <br>
                    
                    Extra time is played over 30 minutes (two 15-minute halves) after the regulation 90 minutes are over. <br> If a team emerges as the winner in the extra time, the match is over.
                    
                    If the teams are still deadlocked after the 120 minutes <br> and injury time, penalty shootouts are forced.
                    
                    In penalty shootouts, players from the two teams take penalty kicks alternately. <br></p>
