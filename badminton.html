                    <h1> BADMINTON RULES </h1>
                    <h3>1. A Game of Two or Four</h3>
                    <p>Badminton can be played as singles or doubles.

                        In a single rally, there will be two players, playing with each other.
                        
                        While in a double rally, you can pair up with your friend and play a game of four. But <br> the players are a set, like the sets of cards.</p>

                    <h3>2. Left or Right</h3>
                    <p>You cannot randomly choose your side as you wish. This is one of the basic badminton rule which needs to be followed for any rally. At the beginning of the game, when the server’s score is even, then you are at the right service court. If the servers score is odd, choose the left side. (yes! Be thorough with odd or even numbers, they do count!!)
                        ‍</p>
                    <h3>3. Know Your Weapons</h3>
                    <p>Badminton is played with a stringed racket and a shuttlecock. The cock is topped with feathers and have a rubber base. The player should always hit the rubber base and not the feathered part. Each player can use a single stringed racket.</p>
                    <h3>4. The Serve</h3>
                    <p>The serve is the basic of any badminton play. Serve is the term used according to badminton rules, to hit the cock during the beginning of each rally. Serve should always be done underarm and below the server’s waist. An overarm serve is against the rules of badminton, and would be considered a fault. (your physics rule of high velocity, does not suffice here!)
                        ‍</p>
                    <h3>5. Begin It By a Toss</h3>
                    <p>The basic rule and regulation of any badminton rally, either Olympics or your family play is that, the game always begins with a toss. When playing with your friends, stop fighting for the first serve, because you are within the box of the badminton rules! The start is only hosted by a toss; the next first serve depends on who wins the rally. If you win the first rally, then the next game begins with your serve. (perks of being the winner).‍
                        ‍</p>
                    <h3>6. The ‘Net’ Trap</h3>
                    <p>The net is a vital and villainous equipment in the play. If the shuttle cock hits the net or even touches the net, disqualified! The point goes to your opponent.</p>
                    <h3>7. Tame Your Hands and Your Feet</h3>
                    <p>While the play is on, your feet should never touch the white line bordered around you. Your hands are your rackets, a hand touch is a foul play, which is beyond the shadow of any doubt.</p>
                    <h3>8. “That’s a Foul Play”!</h3>
                    <p>According to the basic rules of badminton, if your cock touches the ground or if you hit it twice from the same court, that’s considered a foul play. So there’s no replay or second chance. “In the game of badminton, you either loose or win, there’s never a chance!”‍
                        ‍</p>
                    <h3>‍9. Don’t Be A Bully</h3>
                    <p>While a play you should never back or temp your opponent while he/she is serving, which may ward off their concentration. Feinting the opponents or trying to bully them by any means is unpardonably offensive. Being a sportsman you will obviously never be the bullying little kid anymore.‍
                        ‍</p>
                    <h3>10. The Landing</h3>
                    <p>The shuttlecock which is either served or hit, should land inside the service court. Any cock which flew away the white boundaries will not be counted and yes, your opponent will definitely score.
                        ‍</p>
                    <h3> 11. Dock Out!</h3>
                    <p>If the following rules of badminton are continuously broken by a player, then the referee has the undue right to dock out the player’s point or the player from the game. Be alert! Your actions rules your future.</p>
                    <h3>12. 21 Steps Ahead</h3>
                    <p>To win the game of badminton you must score points before your opponent. Out of 3 sets of play you must win 2 to be the talented winner.</p>
