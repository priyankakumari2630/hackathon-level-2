                <h1>football</h1>
                <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, <br>to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. <br>
                Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football <br>
                that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports <br>
                commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, <br>
                Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);<br>
                Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football,<br> arena football, or Canadian football);
                International rules football; rugby league football;<br> and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, <br>
                to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".</p>

                <h1>badminton</h1>
                <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, <br>the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). <br> Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. <br> Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court. <br><br> 

                Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.  <br>Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, <br> or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.
                <br><br>
                    
                The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. <br> In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly.  <br>Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the <br> shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature, and in certain languages the sport is <br> named by reference to this feature (e.g., German Federball, literally feather-ball). <br></p>

                <h1>hockey</h1>
                <p>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both  summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface,they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using <br>sticks to propel a ball or disk into a goal. <br><br>

                There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled or bladed, while others do not. <br>In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word hockey is often preceded by another word i.e  <br>. field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, or floor hockey. <br><br>
                
                In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the <br>opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a puck) with a hole in the center <br>instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were <br>codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified in <br>roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. <br>The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey,<br> is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada <br>in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules <br>for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936. <br><br>

                <h1>table-tennis</h1>
                <p>The sport comes from England during the Victorian era, where it was played by the upper class as a game to be played after meals. It has been suggested that simpler <br> versions of the game should be developed by British military officers living in India during the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it  <br>back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf ball. <br><br>

                The name "ping-pong" was in wide use before the British manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd coined the term in 1901. <br>  The name "ping-pong" then came to describe the game played using Jaques's rather expensive equipment, with other <br>manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the "ping-pong"<br>
                name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920s making the various <br>associations change their names to "table tennis" instead of the more common, but trademarked name. <br></p>
